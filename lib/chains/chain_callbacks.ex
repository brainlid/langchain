  Defines the callbacks fired by an LLMChain and LLM module.

  A callback handler is a map that defines the specific callback event with a
  function to execute for that event.

  ## Example

  A sample configured callback handler that forwards received data to a specific
  LiveView.

      live_view_pid = self()

      my_handlers = %{
        on_llm_new_message: fn _context, new_message -> send(live_view_pid, {:received_message, new_message}),
