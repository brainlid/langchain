# Project Overview

This is a published Elixir packaged called Elixir LangChain. It is inspired by the Python and TypeScript LangChain libraries, however this library is not as large or sprawling. This library maintains a functional programming design as well.

The purpose of the library is to provide an application with an abstraction layer that can support numerous different LLMs like Anthropic Claude, OpenAI ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, Google Gemini, Mistral, Llama, etc. without significant changes to the project's code.

The AI-specific modules are:
- [chat_anthropic.ex](mdc:lib/chat_models/chat_anthropic.ex)
- [chat_open_ai.ex](mdc:lib/chat_models/chat_open_ai.ex)
- [chat_google_ai.ex](mdc:lib/chat_models/chat_google_ai.ex)
- [chat_mistral_ai.ex](mdc:lib/chat_models/chat_mistral_ai.ex)
- etc

The module handles converting to and from the library's data structures like a LangChain.Message into the structure expected by the LLM/service. This includes tool support using a LangChain.Function.

## Tests

Use TDD when working with tests and code.

Tests tagged with `@tag live_call: true` make live API calls to an LLM and are not run by default. These tests can fail sometimes when the behavior of the LLM varies the output significantly. In general, avoid running live calls.

```elixir
@tag live_call: true, live_anthropic: true
test "decodes a live thinking event" do
  llm =
    ChatAnthropic.new!(%{
      stream: true,
      model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
      thinking: %{type: "enabled", budget_tokens: 1024}
    })

  # ...
end
```

Test fixtures are functions located in [fixtures.ex](mdc:test/support/fixtures.ex).

## Writing Code

Don't remove large blocks of commented out code when generating new code unless explicitly instructed to do so.

## Writing Tests

When practical, prefer to make test assertions using pattern matching rather than checking list lengths and extracting items by index.

Avoid:
```elixir
  # Should have patched the dangling tool call
  assert length(processed_state.messages) == 3
  tool_message = Enum.at(processed_state.messages, 1)
  assert tool_message.role == :tool
```

Favor:
```elixir
  # Should have patched the dangling tool call
  assert [_msg1, %ToolMessage{role: :tool} = tool_msg, _] = processed_state.messages
```

Or favor this format when more than 1 assertion will be made:
```elixir
  # Should have patched the dangling tool call
  assert [_msg1, tool_msg, _] = processed_state.messages
  assert tool_msg.role == :tool
```
