# OpenAI Deep Research with LangChain

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:langchain, path: "..", env: :dev}
])
```

## Introduction

This notebook demonstrates how to use OpenAI Deep Research with LangChain Elixir. Deep Research is a powerful tool that can conduct comprehensive research on complex topics, taking 5-30 minutes to analyze hundreds of sources and provide detailed reports with citations.

## Setup

First, ensure you have an OpenAI API key with access to Deep Research models:

```elixir
# Set your OpenAI API key
# You can set this as an environment variable: OPENAI_KEY=your_key_here
# Or configure it directly (not recommended for production):
# Application.put_env(:langchain, :openai_key, "your_key_here")

# Import required modules
alias LangChain.Tools.DeepResearch
alias LangChain.ChatModels.ChatOpenAI
alias LangChain.Chains.LLMChain
alias LangChain.Message
```

## Basic Deep Research Example

Let's start with a simple research request:

```elixir
# Create a DeepResearch tool
{:ok, deep_research_tool} = DeepResearch.new()

# Display the tool configuration
IO.inspect(deep_research_tool, label: "Deep Research Tool")
```

## Quick Research with o4-mini-deep-research

For faster results, let's use the mini model for a straightforward research question:

```elixir
# Create an LLM chain with Deep Research capability
model = ChatOpenAI.new!(%{temperature: 0, stream: false})

{:ok, chain} =
  %{llm: model, verbose: true}
  |> LLMChain.new!()
  |> LLMChain.add_message(
    Message.new_user!("""
    Research the current state of electric vehicle adoption in 2024. 
    Use the faster deep research model and focus on:
    - Market share statistics
    - Key trends and challenges
    - Major developments from leading manufacturers
    
    Keep the research concise but comprehensive.
    """)
  )
  |> LLMChain.add_tools(DeepResearch.new!())
  |> LLMChain.run(mode: :while_needs_response)

# Display the research results
IO.puts(chain.last_message.content)
```

## Advanced Research with Custom Parameters

For more complex research, you can customize the Deep Research parameters:

```elixir
# Create a custom research query with specific parameters
research_query = """
Conduct an in-depth analysis of the economic impact of artificial intelligence on job markets globally. Focus on:

1. Quantitative data on job displacement and creation (2020-2024)
2. Industry-specific impacts (manufacturing, services, healthcare, finance)
3. Geographic variations (US, EU, Asia-Pacific)
4. Policy responses and their effectiveness
5. Future projections and recommendations

Prioritize peer-reviewed research, government reports, and authoritative economic analysis.
"""

# Note: This would use the full o3-deep-research model which takes 5-30 minutes
# For demonstration, we'll show how to structure the request

manual_execution_example = fn ->
  # This is how you would execute a comprehensive research request
  deep_research_args = %{
    "query" => research_query,
    "model" => "o3-deep-research-2025-06-26",  # Full model for comprehensive research
    "system_message" => "You are an expert economic researcher. Provide detailed analysis with specific statistics and cite all sources.",
    "max_tool_calls" => 75,  # Allow more web searches for comprehensive coverage
    "background" => true  # Run in background mode
  }
  
  # Execute the research (this would take 5-30 minutes in real usage)
  DeepResearch.execute(deep_research_args, %{})
end

IO.puts("Advanced research configuration prepared. In production, this would initiate a 5-30 minute comprehensive research process.")
```

## Working with Research Results

Deep Research returns detailed results with citations. Here's how to work with them:

```elixir
# Example of how research results are structured
example_result = """
## Research Findings

Artificial Intelligence is significantly reshaping global job markets with both displacement and creation effects. According to recent studies, approximately 12% of current jobs face high automation risk, while AI is simultaneously creating new roles in data science, AI development, and human-AI collaboration.

### Key Statistics (2020-2024)
- Job displacement: 2.9 million roles automated globally
- Job creation: 4.1 million new AI-related positions
- Net job creation: +1.2 million positions
- Fastest growing sectors: Healthcare AI (+340%), Financial AI (+280%)

### Industry-Specific Impacts
Manufacturing shows the highest displacement rates (18% of roles) but also significant upskilling opportunities. The healthcare sector demonstrates net positive job creation with AI augmenting rather than replacing medical professionals.

## Integration with LLM Chains

Deep Research works seamlessly with LangChain's conversation flows:

```elixir
# Example of multi-turn conversation with research
conversation_flow = fn ->
  model = ChatOpenAI.new!(%{temperature: 0.3})
  
  # Start with user question
  {:ok, chain} =
    %{llm: model}
    |> LLMChain.new!()
    |> LLMChain.add_message(
      Message.new_user!("I'm writing a policy brief on renewable energy. Can you research the latest developments?")
    )
    |> LLMChain.add_tools(DeepResearch.new!())
    |> LLMChain.run(mode: :while_needs_response)
  
  # Follow up with specific questions based on research
  {:ok, updated_chain} =
    chain
    |> LLMChain.add_message(
      Message.new_user!("Based on that research, what are the top 3 policy recommendations for accelerating adoption?")
    )
    |> LLMChain.run(mode: :while_needs_response)
  
  updated_chain
end

IO.puts("Conversation flow example prepared. This demonstrates how Deep Research integrates with ongoing conversations.")
```

## Best Practices and Tips

```elixir
best_practices = """
## Deep Research Best Practices

### 1. Query Design
- Be specific and detailed in your research questions
- Include the type of sources you want (academic, industry reports, news)
- Specify the time frame if relevant
- Mention the depth and format you need

### 2. Model Selection
- Use o4-mini-deep-research for quick research (minutes)
- Use o3-deep-research for comprehensive analysis (5-30 minutes)

### 3. Parameter Tuning
- Set max_tool_calls to control cost and time
- Use background mode for long research tasks
- Provide system_message for specialized research approaches

### 4. Integration Patterns
- Use in chains for conversational research workflows
- Combine with other tools for multi-modal analysis
- Store results for later reference and follow-up

### 5. Cost Management
- Start with smaller queries to test
- Use max_tool_calls to limit scope
- Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard

## Troubleshooting

```elixir
troubleshooting_guide = """
## Common Issues and Solutions

### API Key Configuration
If you get authentication errors:
- Ensure OPENAI_KEY environment variable is set
- Verify your API key has Deep Research access
- Check your OpenAI organization/project settings

### Timeout Issues
If requests timeout:
- Use background mode for long research
- Check your network connectivity
- Increase timeout settings if needed

### Rate Limiting
If you hit rate limits:
- Use max_tool_calls to reduce API calls
- Space out requests over time
- Check your OpenAI usage dashboard

### Research Quality
To improve research results:
- Be more specific in your queries
- Use system_message to guide the approach
- Specify preferred source types
- Include time constraints when relevant
